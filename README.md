### Codes can be found in the following branches:
- **accuracy** : Multi-camera based branch with accuracy checks 
- **accuracySingleCamera** : Multi-camera based branch with accuracy checks 

- The other branches are behind these final branches. However they show the process that how we developed the whole model.

### How to run the whole project
- Go one of the two branches (accuracy or accuracySingleCamera)
- run ./start.sh in the project workspace
- if the overfitted model is not required add the argument "--no-accuracy"
- if no argument is given then automatically accuray model will start working.
